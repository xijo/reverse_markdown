[![reverse_markdown build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/xijo/reverse_markdown.png)](http://travis-ci.org/#!/xijo/reverse_markdown)

# Installation

Install the gem:

  [sudo] gem install reverse_markdown

If you want to use it in Rails context, add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'reverse_markdown'
```

# Synopsis

Given you have html content as string or Nokogiri document or element just pass it over to the module like this:

```ruby
ReverseMarkdown.parse content
````

However, the old syntax is still supported:

```ruby
ReverseMarkdown.parse_element content
ReverseMarkdown.parse_string content
````

# Tag support

Only basic html tags are supported right now. However, it should not be to difficult to add some. Feel free to contribute or notify me about missing stuff.

- supported tags: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, em, strong, blockquote, code, img, a, hr, li, ol, ul
- nested lists
- inline and block code
